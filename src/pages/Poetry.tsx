Lost my heart, but kept the veins`,

I'm glad you're happy.
The same can't be said for me

Because that's how they raised me
But there's one thing I believe in
And I'm going to say it with the part of me that actually believes
So here's what I believe:`,

But why do you always make it feel I disturbing you
Trying to be better for you so I fit into society

I hate that I took the worse parts of you`,

So I stopped. Guess you can say it's the end of a phase.
Try not to listen to the words my demons say,
Remember the times my demons and I used to play.
Now all they make me do is stand in the rain,`,

Don't really need a lot, just wanna find my peace

Maybe the problems I have shouldn't have been told

Starting to think I should just be quiet, cause everyone gives up`,

Every morning I stare at the mirror and I don't see my reflection anymore
All I see is a kid trapped in his own thoughts begging for a way out with the keys in his hands
And that's when I start to hear the voices again`,
