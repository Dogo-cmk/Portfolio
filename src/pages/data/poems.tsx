    content: `Hey God, can we talk?
Stop whatever the f*** you're doing and listen.
Called a lot of times, but you were always busy.
Sent countless texts, pretty sure you're gonna tell me you didn't see them,
When both of us know you read them.
Lately, being happy is what I've been trying to get used to.
But you had to ruin it, didn't you?
Why take a life from someone who deserved it, and not me?
Just tell me what she did to deserve it.
Like I ain't ever did worse.
Like I ain't the one that keeps on questioning your words.
Fuck all the respect.
When you gave something too hard to digest.
Tell me why I shouldn't put a bullet in my head,
Or cut my wrist and see red.
What was your reason? Tell me the purpose.
Living her life, and you cut it short.
You choose to take a life; why didn't you just take mine?
'Cause I never wanted this.
But I'm pretty sure she needed hers.
Damn, 2 kids who still need her alive.
Now my mom feels more alone.
She just lost her best friend.
It's eating her, with everything else, but she hides and pretends.
Damn, can't you see I'm trying to be strong for her?
Everything good I tried to do has always been for her.
What more do you want?
She loves you, but why did you just make her feel like you abandoned her?
And now I have to deal with her being anxious,
Calling me, trying to deal with her anxiety, when I can't even deal with mine.
Just tell me what did she do wrong?
Heard the news, and felt my heart stop.
Time stopped.
In that moment, heard the devil's voice saying he won.
Then he told me I was just a game between the two of you.
You're just trying to get me to relapse.
And it worked.
'Cause you got me here cursing at you.
Telling me this time he knows what he does.
If so, this is what you get.
Damn, if you're just gonna treat me like a game,
Then I'm gonna treat you like a regret.
Pls, never tell anyone to get me to repent.
If you're just gonna put me in another hell,
Might snap my angel's wing if it tries to preach to me.
Don't ever try to drag me to your wishing well,
If you ain't ever wished me well.
'Cause I know you see how hard I've tried,
Came to you when I was at my lowest, but you still wanted to see how low I could go,
Till I broke my back, and you threw me out into the sun.
Even after that, I still had people helping me crawl back.
You and I tried to move on, but you just had to bring death into my life.
Now feels like I walk around with its stench.
Damn, just stop it.
I can't deal with this anymore.
I can't, I can't keep doing this.
Every time I'm just about to reach your grace, you pull it back and give me a slap in the face.
Every time I'm about to reach heaven's gates,
You send an angel to push me down on my face.
Everything just seems to be against me.
Damn, you got me crying.
You can't lie that you never saw me trying.
Their separation got me dying inside.
And now I think I just took my last breath.
'Cause I can't deal with whatever comes next.
My hands are shaking; I can't even write text.
Stop this.
My heart is broken.
And I am pretty sure you know this.
Always blame the devil when I know it's the both of you who did this.
'Cause pretty, he would never tell me if I just had you by my side for once.
If you ever picked up the f*_ing phone whenever I called.
And just when I was about to find out what hope is,
You kicked me to the side and made me feel hopeless.
'Cause that's a f_* you from you.`

    content: `I wish I could numb this pain
I thought by now I wouldn't complain
Lost my heart, but kept the veins
It's been getting hot, feels like I'm trapped in flames
I tried to talk, but had nothing to say
I want the type of love my heart always gave
But need the love you gave away
My head is clouded with inner hate
Want to leave the past, but can't
Cause of all the traumas that choose to stay
Each day they never leave me, even with all my prayers and faith
I am tired of everyone saying the past is something we all have to live with
Times change, but I still feel the same
Keep telling me this is a phase, you will get over it
If it's been nine years, how is this still a phase?
The hurdles in my life have been making it hard to keep my vision alive
My demons haunt and torment me in my mind
They always seem to thrive
No matter how hard I try to fight
They kick me down and leave me bruised on the ground
I hate the way I get caught up in my emotions
My feelings make me feel like I'm drowning in an open ocean
I always try to deal with them, but it's hard
When you're going through the motion
I'm missing the old me, talking pre-depression
I say that like I even remember who that is
If you knew him, please remind me
When you look at me, do you still see him?
Is he dead? Is he dead?
Don't know who I am
Am I Kaneki or am I Haise?
I put my wall up, but it's not just to protect me
I'm scared of people using me
Sacred to love, cause I know sometimes the devil is in disguise in it
I'll be sticking to myself
Cause I'm not sure I can handle anymore heartaches
After all the pain life has dealt
Now I am stuck here every night
Cry my eyes out to these notes, these verses
I need help, God, please don't act deaf
Damn, I am tired of this front
Wounds heal, but for now, this shit hurts
And these scars don't go`

I'm glad you're happy.
The same can't be said for me
'Cause I am acting.
I'm never gonna get this love thing right
I'm always gonna blame it on them, that's a fact
They made me scared, they made me insecure
They made me feel the worst.
I'm tired, I just wanna know the end result
I'm tired, I always make the same mistakes
I don't wanna hear another heartbreak song
They never did tell me what I did wrong
Was it because I didn't give enough of my love
Or my love wasn't enough?
Now I'm here with a heart that's about to bust
You left me like you didn't care
How could you do this to me after everything?
I have been alone for longer years
But still, I don't know why I can't deal with this
Sit alone, just me and my tears
I gave you all I could
This shouldn't be how things go
You asked me if I loved you, I am sorry I said
But never could show it
You asked me if I cared for you, I proved it
FUCK it
You asked me if I would ever hurt you
I assured you
You asked me for all this, and still fucking left me
All I do now is sit down with the memories
And they hurt me because we couldn't make more
The thoughts I could have given more than I ever had to you hunts me
FUCK me
I ain't gonna put on a hard face and act this shit ain't affecting me
Fuck that shit
This love shit broke me
Fuck it, I need you to hold me
But no, you left me
All I want to do now is scream
Help me, but I can't
Because the pain you caused me is deadly
I never expected you to do this to me
I wasn't ready
When you had a problem, I promised you I would fix it
And when those problems came, tell me who the fuck fixed them?
Tell me
Fuck it, I did
Sorry I wasn't always your shoulder to cry on
Sorry I wasn't that one person you could always rely on
When I couldn't even rely on myself
Fuck how all girls are the same
But you aren't
Fuck how all girls just see my love as something they could play with like it was a mother
fucking game
But you didn't
All you did was get so fucking tired of loving me
Sorry I didn't do enough
Sorry I... FUCK that
I can't sleep without drowning pills
I proved you were the only one that I actually loved and adored
But fuck it, that shit wasn't enough
Why can't I deal with this?
Just tell me why
Did you get tired?
Did I make a mistake?
Did I make you do something that you regret?
That made you tired, and you just left?
FUCK this demons like I didn't have it hard already
Dealing with you leaving me
Now what they gain joy from is taunting me
Telling me you're with someone else
Telling me you never loved me
You just wanted and loved the attention
That to love me was never part of your intentions
That you just needed me for a while
That was your plan
To use me as a fucked up therapy session
But I don't wanna believe them
They keep telling me I should just learn my lesson
That my love is something you just wanted to mess with
But FUCK it, I refuse to believe that crap
Me saying it like my thoughts about you getting tired
Wasn't sicker
Like it didn't make me sick to my stomach
Thought there was someone with you that did more of the listening
Laughing, relating than I could
And even cared about you more than I could
But I ain't gonna lie
I know he is out there
Just waiting for you
That's why I always wanted to do more than enough
So that I will always be him for you
But I guess I couldn't do it
He was out there waiting for you
I am just glad you didn't miss him
But that's the end
You left
So never again will I be so attached
Never again will I be so possessive.`

And I have no one to tell me I am Okay
So I am stuck with the thought in my head that never go away
Nowadays I wish I could just blow out my brain
Or cut deep into one of my veins
My head is like a maze every time I get close to escaping it rearranges
So I am stuck going through the same thought
Here I am again
Writing to the same pain I always feel
But this time feels far worse than the last time I was here
This time I don't think it's possible to even pretend
Like I ain't 1 year older and closer to death
Like every time I breathe I didn't hope it was my last breath
I am tired of telling everyone I have been better
I guess just so I don't have to lie that I am fine
Like I don't scroll through everything that happened in my mind
Trying to move on but it just seems like it's out of my hand
Suicidal thoughts I wanna die I don't wanna lie
Just turned .... but feels like death is gonna be mine pretty soon
While my mates feel like they just got out their cocoon
Had enough of standing on the edge
Started thinking maybe I should jump before I fall off trying to get away from the ledge
And accept my fate
To the kid that took the leap I understand what you felt
And I know what went through your head
I just hope as you fell you felt that peace that you so desperately needed
I hope all the anxiety and depression also faded
Even if it was for a second
Hope you took your final breath as soon as you hit the ground
I just wish you knew you weren't alone in the pain you felt
And you weren't the only one who knew the worse of what life has dealt
I wish you could have spoken out but I also know how hard it is
All we wanted was someone to see the scars we don't show
To hear the words we never said
Just to make us feel understood
I really hope your family can learn to forgive themselves
And understand they weren't to blame for the pain you ran from
Just when I get over one hurdle the devil brings pain just in another form
It always the ones you can't run from`,

Sorry I left you waiting, my heart's been aching
No one broke it, 'cause I know that's what y'all been saying
Thinking a sad guy is only sad because his heart's been broken
Then the sad guy becomes the bad guy when someone makes him angry
Don't you know he covers his insecurities every time he's angry?
Pls don't take this lightly, I am a sad guy living a life I didn't pick
Shouldn't it be okay to not be okay, so I wouldn't have to bother about what people say?
Thinking and knowing if I had everything, it still won't be good life
Feeling like my life is a waste of time, wishing I could give my life to those who needed more
time
Yeah, life, why give yourself to someone like me who doesn't deserve or want you?
And take yourself from people who really needed you?
But I just thought of something, life is just a beautiful pain
Only when we have what we need, do the poor think of life has a beautiful pain?
'Cause they don't have what they need, do they see a reason to breathe?
Do they see a reason to wake up again and say they wanna live?
Imagine yourself without any of the so-called comfort you have
That gives you a chance to live, do you think you can deal with the hardships that life would
give?
Do you think you wouldn't go a whole day without thinking to yourself, you're too tired, you just
wanna leave (death)
Damn God, I just wanna be free
Damn, I feel like there's nothing unique about me
I know someone else has had the same thoughts I have
And has thought about them more profoundly than I have
But still, it keeps me up at night, feeding my anxiety
Making it hard for me to sleep, overthinking and overwhelmed, rhyming, and then writing
Make each night feel like 2 weeks, drown myself in these verses
Just looking for peace, each night I can feel myself sink, deeper into the hole my broken mind
digs`,

Because that's how they raised me
But there's one thing I believe in
And I'm going to say it with the part of me that actually believes
So here's what I believe:
That nothing's ever gonna change
Everything's just gonna be the same
No matter how hard I try
Things never been right for me
I wish I could hide from it
But I can't
I guess that's what you had planned for me
I tried praying
But you have been acting deaf
Then you want me to enter a church to go repent
How the fuck you gon' tell me that
When he acts like he ain't ever seen the traumas that this life done dealt?
I am tired of hearing it's all part of a fucking plan
And I should just wait for his time
His time is best
Yes, I accept
But y'all want me to suffer in hell for how long?
What if I should die?
I just wish you knew how it feels, God
I wish you knew how it feels to be hurt
I wish you knew how it feels to struggle to know your worth
I wish you knew what it's like to cry every night
Listening to those songs
Fuck, I wish you knew what it's like to cry
And know you will never be enough
For the ones you care for
You have fucking no idea how that breaks you
So you're stuck at a crossroad
On how you want to be hated
Do I try and fail to get hated
Or just avoid it
Just to still get fucking hated
By the ones you try so hard not to disappoint
I wish you knew how it feels to cry
As you write your every fucking verse
I wish you knew how it feels to...
I just wish you knew what it's like to be sad
Sorry for the curses
I just want my emotions felt, God
Please, I don't mean it that way
I just wanna let out some steam
Sad, I only feel happy in my dreams
Seeing the ones I love happy
Even if it isn't real
I am tired of being the love ship sinker
Stupid overthinker
I don't believe, but I believe
Because that's how they raised me
I really am sorry
I don't mean to overstep
I don't mean any disrespect
I just wish you understand the pain I have
So please, God, I hope you're merciful unto me
And just hear me out
Things have never worked out for me
Please, I know you have a plan for me
But can you reduce the pain
So I don't have to run from it?
You know what, I ain't who I pretend to be
I ain't a funny guy that doesn't care what people think
And that's one thing that hurts me
What you think and say about me leaves a cut so deep
That's why I already tried to leave
But I never can
Why, God, please don't be mad, God
I don't mean to question you
I just don't understand why you keep me trapped
And let me suffer this pain
God, please, why did I spend 8 years inside that cage
And why am I still in it?
Why can't I just leave it?
Please, I wish you could tell me your reason
Why the past 8 years of my life has been a rainy season
Why is there so much pain that I have to deal with?
God, please, I am begging you
Please take this pain away
God, please, I've been trying my best not to curse
So I tried to be like my idol
Anytime I pick the phone
I carefully watch the words I wrote
Tried to question you
But I don't damn what's wrong with me
Someone once told me you have a dual personality
But that's ain't
I am just one shy, stupid, sad, depressed
Useless, worthless, broken, hopeless, and lost entity
The other side you see is when I let my demons out of me
I wish God you could see what I see
I can't say this enough, God
But I mean no disrespect
I don't mean to overstep
Sometimes, God, I felt like I would have been better never existing
Never expected if that happened
I would have never been neglected, rejected, ignored, embarrassed
Taken for granted, depressed
Then you showed me what I would miss out on
The songs, the hugs, the love, the fun
And for that, I say thank you
If you're out there
And when, if I truly believe
I hope you hear me
Come to my aid and help me
Cause I am at a crossroad`,

I actually ain't surprised you didn't pick up, went straight to voicemail
I am calling you cause I need someone to talk to
I don't know if you are actually going to listen to this
But to be honest, I hope you do
Cause lately, I have been feeling more lost than ever
I thought I was found and saved
But now my thoughts sometimes make me feel like I am drowning in a lake
I know I just want a good listener
It always feels like I am talking to myself
When I come to you and ask you something
Why does it feel like I won't ever get an answer?

Or maybe I am disturbing
Or maybe I am just another annoying little burden
Maybe that's why you never pick up when I call you
Maybe that's why you never call me back
Maybe that's why you watch me fall every time and never lend me a hand

And try and understand why some days I wish I was dead
So I didn't have to worry about what comes next
You know what, now, darn, I'm pissed
I am tired of everyone always telling me to talk to you
And say, "Talk to God, cause he is the one who listens
Even when you think he isn't"
Like you are the only one who really gets it
But how do you want to understand what I have been through
When you are the one that made it happen, but have never been dealt it?
You never felt it, you never felt your heart break from the words they say
Or have your soul damaged by the way your life turned upside down in just a day
Maybe if you had gone through half the things you put me through
Maybe then I would actually believe you actually understand
But you never have, you just sit on your throne
And watch as we suffer, and say you understand when you have never been here
Guess you can say there is a lil disrespect
But what did you expect
When you treat me like I am just a reject or a regret
The kind of person you could never accept
The kind of person that needs to always go to church just to repent then relapse
It's a never ending cycle that I next never know what's comes next
But you
You have never been scared of what comes next
Sigh, a lot of things I keep bottled up deep inside
I am choking on my own words, drowning in my own thoughts
Just want to stay in my head, in my own world, darn God
I am sorry, but I just needed you to know how I feel
I want to say all the things I said here didn't come from my heart

Try not to listen to the words my demons say,
Remember the times my demons and I used to play.
Now all they make me do is stand in the rain,
Then make me question myself if I would ever find my place.
My demons are dangerous, they turned my love into a game,
Walking around with them, yelling in my head during the day.
Maybe I am just another case (OCD),
Every day, I am closer to laying in my casket.
Then I know I will drive through hell on its highway,
Listen to me, please; my head hurts.
I feel my heart has a deep cut,
My demons didn't tell me this was love's cost.
Remember the vision I had of me in hell,
Sitting in a bus, then I got up to see the driver, and I got shocked.
Why? It was because it was my own dead corpse,
Something I am scared of, like having my heart burst.
I feel like my happiness went down the drain,
Then Joy left me, and that makes me lame.
I wish I could delete the dark and hellish thoughts from inside my brain,
I really don't need another lecture on how to deal with the pressure.
When I overthink, my demons derive pleasure,
Do I really have to deal with all these questions?
How did I fall into this deep depression?
All my dreams are hellish; help me, please, I need an inception.
When you see me happy, just know it's just for a while,
Cause my demons are on a time out.
Guess you can say I put them in detention,
They make it hard to make a decision when I hear something.
These demons lie to me and scream in my mind: "Believe us."
They once came to me in a dream; I was locked in a cage, and they had the key.
And they kept repeating, "Release us." Wow, what an irony!
Please don't come to me with "how I should be with God and fight against the devil,"
Cause I ain't that religious; please, I would love to do that my own way.
You turn a way of life into a religion; sigh, y'all make it a sad case sometimes.
Wish I could die next; look at me, to be honest,
I wouldn't like to avoid death cause I don't understand the purpose of this so-called test.
Cause I get a test for a test, a life for another life (think about it).
Look at the time; I think it's time for my med.
I am tired of being sick in the head,
Been through so much pain; sometimes I wish I was dead.
They always made me pray for my daily bread,
But God, it still doesn't feel like I have received any of my dough.
But I ain't gonna question you, though,
Cause I still fear and respect you.
But wild thought, though, if you think about it long enough,

Notepad, jotting down all of my flaws

Millions of people torn in pieces, trying to find a better reason

Thinking that who could heal me, feeling like no one can really see me
Damn, you're back to the same old rhythm
Who said that? Thinking to myself, even if I opened up
Would you really understand me? Yes, my life's a closed book
Which is a topic I don't discuss with people, I want to speak with
C'mon, let me tell you a story, once I tried to open up
And here are some of the things I told you, complicated
Full of anger to cover up my pain, so much inner hate
Pls, you think I didn't know those things I've been in my mind for years
Waited for someone I trusted to lend me an ear
Then you told me things I already knew, damn
God, I am having a breakdown, tear rolling down my eyes
As I write, keep it together, at least for a while
At least until something breaks your mind again
Love ain't really a choice again, guess what, I'm in the rain again
Good, at least no one can see my tears, break down
With no one there, can't just find a way out of here
Feeling like my demons locked me in here
I hate the thoughts I have, most of them are so dark
Ending it isn't out of my plan, but I don't wanna die
I just wanna get relief, but what can I do
When that's the only way I see, why can't you see
Through the disguise, can't you read in-between the lines
Of my rhymes, well, it will soon be over`,

    content:`Stuck in my head, makes me feel alone
Maybe the problems I have shouldn't have been told
Cause now I see everyone I shared them with go
Starting to think I should just be quiet, cause everyone gives up
Even after they try to help, now I see everyone keep their distance
Is it because I told you my problems? Please just let me know
Maybe if I were like you and knew someone like me
I wouldn't wanna stay close to them either, avoid confrontation with them
In any instance, talk to them, but slowly move away into the distance
Why didn't I talk to myself and say, "Dogo, all these problems, shey we no go hide am"
Keep it in the silence and music as we dey try fight am"
But it's too late now, you know my problems like I was a contestant on a show and tell
Now I have to deal with the fact that I watch everyone keep their distance
Like I am on fire, the feeling of loneliness creeps in
And makes me feel like if they got any closer, I would ruin their great life
So let me just add more petrol to the flames and pretend to be happy
As I slowly perfect the act of being a liar, so now I watch myself go down
A slippery slope, going through the same problems I know
Trying to use notes and music to cope
I hate the fact that I can't explain myself so that anyone can understand me
I hate the fact that I feel lonely, I hate the fact that I can't let anyone truly know me
I hate the fact that I can't reconnect with the old me
I hate the fact that my demons are the only ones that know the real me
I hate the fact that I feel like they are the only ones that accept the real me
I hate the thought that no one would accept the real me
When I talk, it always feels like no one is listening
I feel like there is no one else I can reason with, am I alone with all these reasonings?
I am never enough, so now the only thing I can do is watch as everyone is leaving me
Friends and family everywhere, but I still feel alone
I can't deal with the fact that I know everyone is always gonna go
I don't know why, but I guess I have myself to blame
Maybe it's because I am always stuck on the music I play with my phone
Do I truly have a chance in the place up above?
When all I do is question it with the words I wrote
We all got angels, we all got demons
They are both mixed up in my conscience
My demons talk to me, torment me, but all my Angels stand like they don't see
It hurts knowing they are there, but they don't do a single thing
Maybe if I don't believe, I will be able to deal with the pain a little better
But no, I can't, cause that's how I was raised
Now all I know is they watch me fight a battle they know I cannot win`,

    content:`Feel like I am loosing myself again
Every morning I stare at the mirror and I don't see my reflection anymore
All I see is a kid trapped in his own thoughts begging for a way out with the keys in his hands
And that's when I start to hear the voices again
"I am not the same as I once was
I am not the same person I once loved
Where is he
Is he truly gone"
I don't understand the person I have become
Everything starting to feel like a rerun
Always back to the grave I dug my own soul
Just knew it was too good to be true
I just knew the moment I thought I was out of it he would push me right back in
Making sure it a lil bit deeper each time
Falling And my chest is getting heavy again
Feels like I have been pushed back into the cold rain again
The thought I have make it hard to deal with the migraine
Sigh
Fell in love but don't know what words to say
Ohkay maybe I do but I am just protecting my heart so I don't have to feel the pain again
Things I want to say but don't know what words to use
Hours spent just thinking
"You are way too emotional" yeah, maybe you'd understand if you had been through half the
things I've been through
Things I kept silence, thought that kept me silent
Tears falling from your eyes without a reason
Feelings kept inside a bottle, not broken but the cracks are so deep and sharp they make you
bleed from just a touch
The cracks sometimes deepen from just a word
Said by someone without knowing the weight their words carry to someone like me
Deep inside I am hurt but it's Ohkay, I am used to it
Even though the pressure I feel is crushing
Sure you tell me about your burden
Will offer you a hand when I need two
Just to tell me
"Everything will be alright"
Even if it is just a lie
(But you've been told that many times)
I know
But a lie is always kind
Even if the only kind of kindness I get
Sigh.`,
